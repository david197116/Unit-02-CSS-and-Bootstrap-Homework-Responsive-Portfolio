# Unit-02-CSS-and-Bootstrap-Homework-Responsive-Portfolio
Updateas of 12/04/19 :
Added class project to portfolio, still work in progress but have some available working functions. You can sear for recipies base of what you have on your pantry jsut make sure add a comma after each ingridient. Available cooking recipies display form most request with pitctures of the menu. For the Drinks Menu, avaiable API only provide 1 option to search,  working on full recipies as well as diet or allergies options.

This was definitely a challenging assignment. I know that not every requirement was probably met; but, it was an opportunity to get better.  I don't think I got the responsive required on my picture profile; however, I could be right and I don't know it ( please let me know).  I try to minimize or don't use the media queries; however, I couldn't not find another way to get this to work. Any advice and coaching are welcome. I tried to stick to the instructions but we had the flexibility to make it different. My ultimate goal was to get as close as the requirement and improve from here.
