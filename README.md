# Unit-02-CSS-and-Bootstrap-Homework-Responsive-Portfolio
This was definitely a challenging assignment. I know that not every requirement was probably met; but, it was an opportunity to get better.  I don't think I got the responsive required on my picture profile; however, I could be right and I don't know it ( please let me know).  I try to minimize or don't use the media queries; however, I couldn't not find another way to get this to work. Any advice and coaching are welcome. I tried to stick to the instructions but we had the flexibility to make it different. My ultimate goal was to get as close as the requirement and improve from here.
